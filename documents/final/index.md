### Technical Approach

#### Implementation



#### Problem and Solution

1. In rendering part, our first implementation is to render each square of the grid separately, namely pass the color to fragment shader and then render a square. This implementation greatly limitted the performance. To tackle this problem, instead of drawing many squares, we only draw one window-size square with texture map of the entire grid. In this manner, we got a 50X speed up for 300 Ã— 300 grid size.
