#### Physical Simulation

#### Smoke Generation (Mouse Tracking)
We generate smoke by tracking the clicks and drags of mouse. Callback funtions will catch the cursor movement (static mouse click is specially shandled), setting density and temperature fields correspondingly. To better simulate the emission of smoke, we update the density and temperature fields of all the grids in a certain distance from the mouse. We also adds quadratic fall-off to the emission fields, similar to the definition of irradiance.

Besides, we add HSV color fields to the smoke, which is an intuitive color model. We set HUE as a range of value determined by temprature, with the color wheel's select the center of range. We set Satuaration to 100.0, which represents primary colors. We set Value, which stands for brightness, to density of smoke naturally. The HSV fields are finally transformed to RGB and displayed on screen. 

#### Rendering

The rendering part can be separated into three stages:

1. Generate the density map and temperature map from simulation.
2. Convert density and temperature map into RGB texture map.
3. Use shader program to map the texture map to screen.

Specifically, for the seconde step, we create a char array with capacity $3\times W\times H$, where $W$ and $H$ are width and height of the grid, respectively. %%%%Fangzhou please write here%%%% We then save the RGB color to the array, which is basically a texture map now. After that, we pass the array to fragment shader as a 2D sampler, and render the grid.

#### GUI
We added nanogui to our project from scratch. Widgets we used includes sliders for configuring smoke parameters and a color wheel.

#### Optimizations
We should accelerate simulation part in order to achieve a frequency of more than 60 FPS.

+ Using OpenMP: We configured OpenMP and added pragma of OpenMP before each time-consuming loops of simulation part. We have to make sure that we do not parallel the time steps by accident. Simply by these we get a acceleration of 4-5 times on a 6-core Macbook Pro.

+ Using references and move constructors: We use reference of variables instead of a new copy if possible. Besides, we prefer move constructor of class objects instead of copy constructor to reduce unnecessary copy. 

### Problems and Solutions

1. In rendering part, our first implementation is to render each square of the grid separately, namely each time pass one color to fragment shader and then render a square. This implementation greatly limitted the performance. To tackle this problem, instead of drawing many squares, we only draw one window-size square with texture map of the entire grid. In this manner, we got about 50X speed up for grid size  300 Ã— 300.

2. In the mouse tracking part, at first we update the position only once in a simulation & rendering round, causing obvious stutter and discontinuity in generation of smoke. Then we tried multithread in C++11, which also seemed strange in the generation of smoke. One possible reason is that we could't make a good schedule of the threads easily. At last, we solved it by putting this part to the cursor-movement callback function.

3. About organization of project files, we used lots of extern and global declarations and included many common headers at first, which is problematic when the project size becomes large. We solved it by Singleton Pattern: organizing most of the global variables into static variables of a class.
